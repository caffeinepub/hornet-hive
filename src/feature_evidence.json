      "featureTitle": "Update `frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts` so the `useGetCallerUserProfile` bootstrap path reaches a terminal state even when the backend actor initialization stays `isFetching` indefinitely (e.g., actor creation hangs while calling `_initializeAccessControlWithSecret`). Specifically: start the existing actor-initialization timeout countdown when `actor` is null regardless of whether `actorFetching` is true or false, and after the timeout ensure the profile query runs and fails with a user-visible error instead of leaving the UI in a perpetual loading state.",
