  "summary": "Backend changes add a per-comment `likedBy` set and a migration module, and frontend changes show a toast on duplicate-like errors. However, the diff summary does not provide evidence that `likeComment(postId, commentId)` now enforces the one-like-per-caller rule with a clear English trap message and no likes increment on repeat calls.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Enforce a one-like-per-student-per-comment rule in the backend so the same authenticated caller cannot successfully like the same comment more than once (including trapping with a clear English message on duplicates and not incrementing likes).",
      "reason": "The diff summary shows new data structures (`likedBy : Set.Set<Principal>`) and a migration initializing it, but does not show any implementation/changes to the `likeComment(postId, commentId)` method logic (e.g., checking `likedBy`, preventing increment, and trapping with an English message). With the backend file truncated, enforcement cannot be verified from the provided evidence.",
