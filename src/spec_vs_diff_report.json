  "summary": "Diff adds per-post likedBy tracking types and a migration module, and updates the PostCard UI to toast on duplicate-like errors. However, the backend likePost enforcement and deterministic duplicate-like error message are not evidenced in the provided diff summary (backend/main.mo is truncated before likePost). The diff also appears to introduce several unrelated backend/frontend features (profiles, moderation, notifications, polls, suspension) that were not requested.",

      "reason": "The diff shows the new `likedBy` field added to `Post` and a migration module, but the likePost implementation and its duplicate-like rejection/error message are not present in the visible (truncated) backend/main.mo excerpt, so enforcement and the deterministic error text cannot be verified from this summary.",
